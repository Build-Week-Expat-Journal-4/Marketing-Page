          <h2>Project - Expat Journal</h2>
          <p>As an expat, I want to be able to show off the places I've been and remember them for myself. I have a lot of amazing pics and stories from around the world I'd like to share, but I need a site that is more personal than Instagram in order to do so.</p>
        <p> User can visit site and see photos laid out in a grid. Travelers can create, read, update, and delete stories and photos.</p>
